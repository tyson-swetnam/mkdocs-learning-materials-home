What is CyVerse? \u00b6 CyVerse provides life scientists with powerful computational infrastructure to handle huge datasets and complex analyses, thus enabling data-driven discovery. Our extensible platforms provide data storage, bioinformatics tools, data visualization, interactive analyses, cloud services, APIs, and more. CyVerse cyberinfrastructure includes: A data storage facility called the Data Store An interactive, web-based, analytical data science workbench called the Discovery Environment or DE for short. Cloud infrastructure to access remote servers for computation, analysis, and storage called Atmosphere and Jetstream Web authentication and security services via KeyCloak and OAuth Support for scaling computational algorithms to run on large, high-speed computers Education and training in how to use cyberinfrastructure (these pages!) People with expertise in all of the above to help you and your team Account Creation \u00b6 Create a CyVerse account Data Store \u00b6 Data Store Guide Discovery Environment Workbench \u00b6 Find apps in the Discovery Environment Guide VICE \u00b6 Visual Interactive Compute Environment (VICE) includes popular integrated development environments: JupyterLab , RStudio, and VSCode. Instant and on demand virtual machines running Ubuntu Linux command line interface. Remote Desktops for high quality visualizations in your browser GPU computing for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Cloud \u00b6 CyVerse created Atmosphere, a browser interface for working with OpenStack Cloud virtual machines Partnered with NSF XSEDE/ACCESS Jetstream-2 for more and larger virtual machines.
